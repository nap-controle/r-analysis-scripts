This European Directive aims to support the coordinated deployment and use of ITS beyond the borders of the Member States. EU Member States must regularly inform the European Commission (EC) of the progress made in the deployment of the planned national actions in the field of ITS.

On July 15, 2014, the Belgian State, the Brussels-Capital Region, the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region signed a cooperation agreement which creates an ITS Steering Committee whose missions cover in particular:

•	Coordination and cooperation between the different Belgian entities for the preparation of reports to the EC;

•	Exchange of technical, legal and legislative information;

•	The representation of Belgium in international fora on the basis of a common position;

•	The participation of Belgian experts in the preparation of EC ITS delegated acts.

The missions of the ITS Steering Committee can be extended.

The Steering Committee established internal regulations. Each entity is represented on the ITS Steering Committee by a maximum of four ordinary members, one of whom is a voting member. The secretariat is provided by the FPS Mobility and Transport. The Committee is chaired by an elected president.

The bike sharing project “Blue-bike” was founded mid 2011 by the former NMBS-holding and FIETS&WERK, to put combined transport into practice. Blue-bike is a bike share scheme with bikes on mobihubs spread across Belgium, with now more than 65 Blue-bike locations. More info: www.blue-bike.be 

Blue-mobility (with shareholders De Lijn, FIETS&WERK en TEC) is responsible for the operational functioning and rent of Blue-bikes. Local bike points provide our bike maintenance. The Flemish government supports Blue-bike in partnership with local municipalities by discounting the standard fare (€1,15 instead of €3,15 per 24h). Ethias is a commercial partner who also provides bike assistance to Blue-bike members.  In 2019 Blue-bikes made a total of 276.000 Blue-bike rides with 20 000 member on 65 locations. 

A survey of 2013 and 2015, commissioned by De Lijn and done by IPSOS, and the European project BITIBI to which Blue-mobility contributed from 2015 to 2017 offered following insights: 93% of the Blue-bike members uses Blue-bike in combination with a train journey. 32% of the Blue-bike rides was not made before the arrival of Blue-bike, or were made by car (22%).
